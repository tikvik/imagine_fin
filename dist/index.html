            <p>Welcome to the first podcast brought to you by the IMAGINE Project, run by Professor Jan Komarek and hosted at the iCourts Centre of Excellence for International Courts, University of Copenhagen. IMAGINE works on the Intellectual History of European Constitutional Imaginaries. Today, we will talk to Jan Komarek about his project. What is it that Jan wants to find out about the EU and its constitutional law? What does Joseph Weiler, one of the most famous and influential theorists of European Union constitutional law, have to do with Jan’s&nbsp;project? Is Jan critical towards the current paradigm of European Union law and its internal market? Is he critical about the role of the Court of Justice, traditionally depicted as a&nbsp;constitutional engine of European integration? Does he think that the constitutional vocabulary of the EU could and should be different? And, last but not least, can Karl Marx and political economy tell us something about EU law and its internal market today?</p>
